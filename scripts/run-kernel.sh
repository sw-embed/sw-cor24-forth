# run-kernel.sh — assemble a COR24 kernel source and run it in the emulator.
#
#   scripts/run-kernel.sh <kernel.s> [cor24-emu options...]
#
# The assembler and the emulator are separate programs (cor24-asm from
# sw-cor24-x-assembler, cor24-emu from sw-cor24-emulator); the old combined
# `cor24-run --run file.s` is gone. This is the one place that joins them:
# every script and regression test in this repository runs a kernel through
# here, so `cor24-run --run K OPTS` became `scripts/run-kernel.sh K OPTS`.
#
# The assembled .lgo is a private temporary file, so parallel test runs never
# share one, and it is removed on exit. The emulator's exit status is the
# script's.
#
# cor24-emu stops after 10 s of wall-clock time by default, which a busy
# machine or a parallel test run reaches long before the instruction budget
# (-n) runs out, silently cutting the output short. So unless the caller
# passes -t/--time, this script passes --time ${RUN_KERNEL_TIME:-600}; -n
# remains the real limit.
#
# Tools are found on PATH first. Failing that, COR24_ASM / COR24_EMU name
# them explicitly, then the sibling checkouts' release builds, then the
# binaries vendored by sw-tos.
